but the way you can do this is with a 3-4 blocks of:
- esm self attn of ag<>ag (full protein target)
- esm self attn of ab<>ab (full peptide binder)
- cross attn of ab<>epitope (attend ab to epitope)
- cross attn of epitope<>ab (cross attend epitope to ab)


> instead of that:
self attn similar to ESM layers of:
- scvi
- pseudotime
- scvi + pseudotime combined

cross_attn
- scvi<>protein
- pseudotime<>protein
- scvi + pseudotime combined <> protein
