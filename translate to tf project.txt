but the way you can do this is with a 3-4 blocks of:
- esm self attn of ag<>ag (full protein target)
- esm self attn of ab<>ab (full peptide binder)
- cross attn of ab<>epitope (attend ab to epitope)
- cross attn of epitope<>ab (cross attend epitope to ab)


> instead of that:
self attn similar to ESM layers of:
- scvi
- pseudotime
- scvi + pseudotime combined

cross_attn
- scvi<>protein
- pseudotime<>protein
- scvi + pseudotime combined <> protein




what we have already:
-----------------------
Self-attention of scVI: Yes
Self-attention of pseudotime: No
Self-attention of scVI+pseudotime combined: No
Cross-attention scVI<>protein: Yes
Cross-attention pseudotime<>protein: No
Cross-attention (scVI + pseudotime combined)<>protein: Partially


how? 
Self-attention:
UNet model includes AttentionBlock1D and SpatialTransformer1D components, which implement self-attention mechanisms. These are analogous to the ESM self-attention layers you described.
Cross-attention:
The SpatialTransformer1D module in your UNet includes cross-attention functionality. Specifically, the BasicTransformerBlock within SpatialTransformer1D has two attention mechanisms:

self.attn1: Self-attention
self.attn2: Cross-attention (can attend to a separate context)





how to modify to get desired output:

In the CustomUNet1D class, modify the __init__ method:

def __init__(self, ..., pseudotime_dim=1):
    # ... (existing initialization)
    self.scvi_pseudotime_combiner = nn.Linear(in_channels + pseudotime_dim, in_channels)
    # ... (rest of initialization)

Modify the forward method of CustomUNet1D:

def forward(self, x, timesteps, context, pseudotime):
    # x: [batch_size, 1024, 50] (scVI embeddings)
    # context: [batch_size, seq_len, context_dim] (protein embeddings)
    # pseudotime: [batch_size, 1024, 1]

    # Combine scVI and pseudotime
    combined = torch.cat([x, pseudotime], dim=-1)
    combined = self.scvi_pseudotime_combiner(combined)

    # Self-attention on scVI
    h_scvi = self.scvi_self_attn(x)
    
    # Self-attention on pseudotime
    h_pseudo = self.pseudo_self_attn(pseudotime)
    
    # Self-attention on combined
    h_combined = self.combined_self_attn(combined)

    # ... (rest of the forward method)

    for module in self.input_blocks:
        if isinstance(module, SpatialTransformer1D):
            h = module(h, context, x, pseudotime, combined)
        else:
            h = module(h)

    # ... (rest of the method remains the same)

Modify the SpatialTransformer1D class:

class SpatialTransformer1D(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ..., extra_cross_attention=True):
        # ... (existing initialization)
        if extra_cross_attention:
            self.cross_attn_scvi = CrossAttention(...)
            self.cross_attn_pseudo = CrossAttention(...)
            self.cross_attn_combined = CrossAttention(...)

    def forward(self, x, context, scvi, pseudotime, combined):
        # ... (existing code)

        for block in self.transformer_blocks:
            x = block(x, context)
        
        if hasattr(self, 'cross_attn_scvi'):
            x = self.cross_attn_scvi(x, scvi) + x
            x = self.cross_attn_pseudo(x, pseudotime) + x
            x = self.cross_attn_combined(x, combined) + x

        # ... (rest of the method)

Add new self-attention modules in CustomUNet1D:

self.scvi_self_attn = AttentionBlock1D(in_channels)
self.pseudo_self_attn = AttentionBlock1D(pseudotime_dim)
self.combined_self_attn = AttentionBlock1D(in_channels)
