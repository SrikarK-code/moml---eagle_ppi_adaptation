Protein Binder Generation using Latent Diffusion Models
Project Overview
This project implements a novel approach to generating protein binders for specific target proteins and motifs using latent diffusion models. By leveraging the power of pre-trained protein language models (ESM) and contrastive learning techniques (CLIP), we've developed a flexible and powerful system for de novo protein design.
Model Architecture Workflow

ESM Encoder-Decoder

Input: Protein sequences (binder/target)
Process:
a. ESM model encodes sequences to high-dimensional embeddings (N x 1280)
b. Custom encoder reduces embeddings to latent space (N x 64)
c. Decoder reconstructs sequences from latent space
Output: Predicted protein sequences
Training: Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) Loss


CLIP Model for Protein-Motif Pairs

Inputs:
a. Protein binder sequence (ESM encoded)
b. Target protein sequence (ESM encoded)
Process:
a. Separate encoders for binder and target proteins
b. Project encodings to shared embedding space
Output: Embeddings for protein binder and target protein
Training: Contrastive Loss (maximize similarity for binding pairs, minimize for non-binding pairs)


Latent Diffusion Model

Components:
a. Forward diffusion process: gradually add noise to protein binder latent representations
b. Reverse diffusion (denoising): learn to remove noise conditioned on target protein and motif
Denoiser Architecture:

Input: Noised binder latent, target protein embedding, CLIP embedding, motif embedding, timestep
Process: Series of transformer layers with cross-attention mechanisms
Output: Predicted noise to be removed


Training: Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss between predicted and actual noise


Classifier-Free Guidance

Training:

90% conditional (with target/motif information)
10% unconditional (without target/motif information)


Sampling: Interpolate between conditional and unconditional predictions



Workflow for Generating Motif-Specific Protein Binders

Data Preparation

Preprocess protein sequences and motif information
Generate ESM embeddings for protein binders and target proteins


Model Training

Train ESM Encoder-Decoder on large protein sequence dataset
Train CLIP model on known protein binder-target pairs
Train Latent Diffusion Model:

Forward diffusion: add noise to binder latent representations
Reverse diffusion: train denoiser with classifier-free guidance




Generating New Protein Binders

Input: Target protein sequence and binding motif (sequence or binary representation)
Process:
a. Encode target protein and motif
b. Sample from latent space using reverse diffusion process
c. Apply classifier-free guidance to steer generation
d. Decode latent representations to amino acid sequences


Validation and Refinement

Computationally evaluate generated binders (e.g., docking simulations, ML predictions)
Experimentally test promising candidates
Refine model based on feedback



Usage
pythonCopy# Example usage
protein_seq = "MKTVRQERLKSIVRILERSKEPVSGAQLAEELSVSRQVIVQDIAYLRSLGYNIVATPRGYVLAGG"
motif_seq = "LRSLGY"

# Generate binders with sequence-based motif
binders_seq = generate_protein_binders(model, protein_seq, motif_seq, num_samples=3)

# Generate binders with binary motif representation
binary_motif = torch.zeros(len(protein_seq))
binary_motif[30:36] = 1  # Motif region
binders_binary = generate_protein_binders(model, protein_seq, binary_motif, num_samples=3)

# Generate binders without specific target/motif
binders_no_guidance = generate_protein_binders_without_guidance(model, sequence_length=100, num_samples=3)
Key Features

Flexible motif input: Accept both sequence-based and binary representations of motifs
Classifier-free guidance: Improve control over generation process
Integration of ESM embeddings: Leverage pre-trained protein language models
CLIP-inspired contrastive learning: Enhance relevance of generated binders to targets
