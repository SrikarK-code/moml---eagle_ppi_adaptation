Adapted Model Architecture Workflow:

ESM Encoder-Decoder (Figure 2A):

Input: Protein binder sequence
Process:
a. ESM model encodes the sequence to N x 320 dimensional embedding
b. ESM latent encoder reduces this to N x 64 dimensional latent space
c. Latent decoder reconstructs the sequence from the latent space
Output: Predicted protein binder sequence
Training: Uses Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) Loss


CLIP Model for Protein-Motif Pairs (Figure 2B):

Inputs:
a. Protein binder sequence (encoded by ESM)
b. Target protein sequence (replacing antigen structure)
Process:
a. Protein binder encoder processes ESM-encoded binder sequence
b. Target protein encoder processes the target protein sequence
c. Both encodings are projected to a shared embedding space
Output: Embeddings for protein binder and target protein
Training: Uses symmetric Contrastive Cross-Entropy (CCE) Loss


Denoiser Model (Figure 2C):

Inputs:
a. Target protein sequence (encoded by target protein encoder)
b. Noised protein binder latent representation
c. Timestep t
Process:
a. Target protein encoder (purple) processes the target sequence
b. Denoiser (green) takes the encoded target protein, noised binder latent, and timestep
c. Denoiser predicts the noise to be removed
Output: Predicted ESM latent representation of the protein binder
Training: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss


Sampling Process (Figure 3):

Inputs:
a. Target protein sequence
b. White noise (N x 64 dimensional)
Process:
a. Target protein encoder (purple) processes the target sequence
b. Denoiser (green) iteratively denoises the input noise conditioned on the target protein encoding
c. ESM decoder (yellow) converts the denoised latent representation to a protein sequence
Output: Generated protein binder sequence

Workflow for generating motif-specific protein binders:

Pre-training:

Train the ESM Encoder-Decoder on a large dataset of protein sequences
Train the CLIP model on known protein binder-target pairs


Diffusion Model Training:

Train the Denoiser model using the forward diffusion process and reverse denoising process


Generating New Protein Binders:

Input a target protein sequence and its binding motif
Use the trained models to sample new protein binder sequences
Optionally, use a folding model (like AlphaFold) to predict the structure of generated binders


Validation:

Computationally validate the generated binders (e.g., docking simulations)
Experimentally test promising candidates



This workflow adapts the original antibody-antigen model to your specific use case of generating motif-specific protein binders. The key differences are:

Using target protein sequences instead of antigen structures
Focusing on protein binders rather than antibodies
Considering binding motifs instead of epitopes
